### Hey there, I'm Mike (@mikededo) :wave:

I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript developer who loves building stuff with React,
whether it's building standalone apps or using meta-frameworks like Next.js.
I'm learning other languages such as Go and Rust, to scape a bit of the front-end
world, as I'm working as a FE Engineer. I'm a heavy terminal user, always on the
lookout for new CLI tools that can simplify my development experience (if you are
curious, here are my [`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/mikededo/.dotfiles)).

Although I'm currently studying for a master's degree :book: and have limited time
to contribute to open source projects, I'm always open to collaboration and new
ideas. So if you're interested in working together, or just want to chat about
programming and life, hit me up!

Aside from that, I'm a cyclist love so most of my spare time is spent on my pedals! 
:bicyclist:

#### Dart Barrel File Generator

I once tried developing _Flutter_ apps and I found the necessity of automating the creation of barrel files, since it is something that is really used in the _Flutter_ framework. And, in order to enhance developer experience, I developed ðŸ‘· the extension for Visual Studio Code.

Thanks for stopping by and happy hacking! ðŸš€
