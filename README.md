### Open Source Projects

#### Dart Barrel File Generator

I have been developing _Flutter_ apps and I found the necessity of automating the creation of barrel files, since it is something that is really used in the _Flutter_ framework. And, from the necessity, I created (and currently mantain 👷) the extension for Visual Studio Code.
