## What languages do I use?
### Flutter & Dart 
About half year ago I started learning the fundamentals of Flutter and Dart and now I design apps during my free time!

### Javascript 
Javascript was one of the first languages I learnt. Since then, I've been developing mostly (and very simple) backend applications for some of my flutter apps.

### HTML & CSS
With JavaScript, I learnt a bit of web developement, mostly with Brad Traversy courses (on Youtube and Udemy).

### Java & C++
I've been taught both languages in the University, however, when I have to develop small windows applications I prefer to use Java!
