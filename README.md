### Hey there, I'm Mike (@mikededo) :wave:

I am frontend developer who loves building stuff with React and Svelte, whether
it's building standalone apps or using meta-frameworks like Next.js. I am also
interested in other languages such as Go and Rust, to scape a bit from the
front-end world, as I am currently working as a FE Engineer. I really enjoy
working from the terminal, so I am always on the look for new CLI tools that can
simplify my developer experience (even storing all my configs on a repo, so I
can move from OS or computers with a simple `git clone`:
[.dotfiles](https://github.com/mikededo/.dotfiles)

I am always open to collaboration and new ideas. So if you're interested in working
together, or just want to chat about programming and life, hit me up!

Aside from that, I'm a cyclist love so most of my spare time is spent on my pedals! 
:bicyclist:

### :open_hands: Open Source projects and ideas

#### Dart Barrel File Generator

I started my frontend developer journey developing _Flutter_ apps and I found
the necessity of automating the creation of barrel files, since it is something
that is really used in the _Flutter_ framework. And, in order to enhance
developer experience, I developed ðŸ‘· the extension for Visual Studio Code.

#### Squared CI

Once of the projects that I invested most time of, was a GitHub Actions builder,
with the idea of simplifying the process of coding and configuring GitHub
Actions. The idea was to have a no-code application (or little-code) that would
end up generating a workflow file!
I started focusing on other ideas, and the project is not finished. However, you
can check it at: [Squared CI](https://squared-ci.vercel.app)
