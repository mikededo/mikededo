### Hey there, I'm Mike (@mikededo) :wave:

I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript developer who loves building stuff with React,
whether it's building standalone apps or using meta-frameworks like Next.js.
I'm learning other languages such as Go and Rust, to scape a bit of the front-end
world, as I'm working as a FE Engineer. I'm a heavy terminal user, always on the
lookout for new CLI tools that can simplify my development experience (if you are
curious, here are my [`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/mikededo/.dotfiles)).

I'm always open to collaboration and newideas. So if you're interested in working
together, or just want to chat about programming and life, hit me up!

Aside from that, I'm a cyclist love so most of my spare time is spent on my pedals! 
:bicyclist:

### :open_hands: Open Source Projects

#### Dart Barrel File Generator

I once tried developing _Flutter_ apps and I found the necessity of automating
the creation of barrel files, since it is something that is really used in the
_Flutter_ framework. And, in order to enhance developer experience, I developed
ðŸ‘· the extension for Visual Studio Code.

#### Squared CI

On my spare time, I'm also working with a tool that simplifies the process of
developing GitHub Actions. The idea is to have a no-code like application that
ends up generating a workflow file!  
The application is still under development, and is nowhere close to be finished!
You can try it in: [squared-ci.vercel.app](https://squared-ci.vercel.app/)

Thanks for stopping by and happy hacking! ðŸš€
