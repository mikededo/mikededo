### Hey there, I'm Mike (@mikededo) :wave:

I am frontend developer who loves building stuff with React and Svelte, whether
it's building standalone apps or using meta-frameworks like Next.js. I am also
interested in other languages such as Go and Rust, to scape a bit from the
front-end world, as I am currently working as a FE Engineer. I really enjoy
working from the terminal, so I am always on the look for new CLI tools that can
simplify my developer experience (even storing all my configs on a repo, so I
can move from OS or computers with a simple `git clone`:
[.dotfiles](https://github.com/mikededo/.dotfiles)

I am always open to collaboration and new ideas. So if you're interested in working
together, or just want to chat about programming and life, hit me up!

Aside from that, I'm a cyclist love so most of my spare time is spent on my pedals! 
:bicyclist:

### :open_hands: Open Source projects and ideas

#### [WIP] Svelte TailwindCSS Eslint Plugin

Since I do not use Prettier (https://antfu.me/posts/why-not-prettier - got
inspired by @antfu), most of my projects are built using TailwindCSS. While I
have used TailwindCSS's Prettier plugin, I could not find a solution that worked
_with Svelte_ for TailwindCSS. So, I'm working on a port of
`eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` that's Svelte specific.

#### Svelte development

Instead of having many repos with different projects, I decided to centralise
everything in a monorepo, in which I have all of my Svelte applications as well
as libraries.  
The apps on it are made for me to learn and practise Svelte, as well as to help
me on my daily basis.

#### Dart Barrel File Generator

I started my frontend developer journey developing _Flutter_ apps and I found
the necessity of automating the creation of barrel files, since it is something
that is really used in the _Flutter_ framework. And, in order to enhance
developer experience, I developed ðŸ‘· the extension for Visual Studio Code.

#### Squared CI

Once of the projects that I invested most time of, was a GitHub Actions builder,
with the idea of simplifying the process of coding and configuring GitHub
Actions. The idea was to have a no-code application (or little-code) that would
end up generating a workflow file!
I started focusing on other ideas, and the project is not finished. However, you
can check it at: [Squared CI](https://squared-ci.vercel.app)
